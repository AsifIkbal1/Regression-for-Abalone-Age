Regression for Abalone Age
Data setÂ¶
The Abalone dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is a popular dataset used for regression and classification tasks. It contains information about physical measurements of abalone (a type of shellfish) and the number of rings (which is related to the age of the abalone).

Here are the attributes in the dataset:
Sex: The gender of the abalone (M, F, I for male, female, and infant).

Length: Longest shell measurement (in mm).

Diameter: Diameter perpendicular to length (in mm).

Height: Height of the shell (in mm).

Whole weight: Whole abalone weight (in grams).

Shucked weight: Weight of the meat (without shell) (in grams).

Viscera weight: Gut weight after bleeding (in grams).

Shell weight: Weight of the shell after being dried (in grams).

Rings: Number of rings (which can be used to estimate the age of the abalone).

The goal of using this dataset can vary. For example, one might want to predict the age of the abalone based on its physical measurements (a regression task) or classify whether an abalone is an infant, male, or female based on its measurements (a classification task).
